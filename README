Reference Android implementation that uses the #SAPNWCloud backend for Mobile push message https://github.com/elsewhat/nwcloud-androidgcm-backend
For introduction to project, please see

It will register the device for Google Cloud Messaging for my personal Google API project on startup. 
Afterwards, you will be able to send mobile push messages to other mobile devices that have run this app.

Update PROJECT_ID in https://github.com/elsewhat/nwcloud-androidgcm-app/blob/master/src/org/sapmentors/nwcloud/gcm/GCMIntentService.java to your own Google API project.

Uses backend https://androidgcmbackendp013234trial.nwtrial.ondemand.com/nwcloud-androidgcm-backend/
(modify in https://github.com/elsewhat/nwcloud-androidgcm-app/blob/master/src/org/sapmentors/nwcloud/gcm/backend/NWCloudBackend.java)

Currently requires Android 4.0  (though can be downported easily)
